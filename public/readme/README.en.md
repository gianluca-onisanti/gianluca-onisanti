# Portfolio: Gianluca Onisanti

Welcome to my website's source code. There are too portfolio repos, but this one is the current one!
---

## ðŸ§ª Technologies Used:

- **Next.js**: the chosen frontend framework. Simply the best one, Practical, robust, and scalable in case I want to build more functionalities.
- **Material UI**: easy and open for customization, this component ibrary packs-a-punch when building the frontend.
- **useTranslations (by me)**: yeah! An internationalization Hook created by me. Previously used for another Docker project in order to run straightforwardly, I decided to bring it here.
- **Vercel**: where the application is hosted! Listening to new features as soon as I deploy them, It's free and works quite good with React based applications.

## ðŸŒŸ Differentiators:

- **Themes:** we have a switcher between light and dark themes, but I decided to add I grain of authenticity. ðŸŒ»ðŸŒ¸
- **Internationalization**: hey, english speaker! There's room for you even on the README. Crazy, didn't it?
- **Animations and Responsive Design**: the app was design to work across devices, delivering a pleasant and memorable experience to its users.
